=== Endpoints that are built in this project:

Create an application to store a data of students present in a class room
        Student (id, name)

1. GET /students  -- should give details of all students
2. GET /students/{id}  -- should give details of the particular student with that 'id'
3. POST /students  -- add a new student's details
4. PUT /students/id  -  update an existing student's details
5. DELETE /students/id  - deletes the particular student's details


=== Springboot annotations (used in this project):

1. @SpringBootApplication
2. @RestController
 - @RequestMapping(value = "/path/{var}?param=123", method ="RequestMethod.GET")
 - @GetMapping(value = "/path")
 - @PathVariable("var")
 - @RequestBody - used for request bodies in PUT, POST
 - @RequestParam("param")
3. @Service
4. @Autowired
5. @Entity
6. @Id

*NOTE: @Service, @Controller , @Repository all specializations of @Component type (In spring @Component allows implementation classes to be autodetected through the classpath scanning.)*

=== Configuring a springboot app.
Using  an `application.properties` file enables one to configure certain properties for the springboot app.
There are certain keys available which need to be defined in the app.props file as per the requirement.
These predefined keys can be found in : https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/common-application-properties.html

=== Spring JPA (Java Persistence API)
- JPA is an api that let's us to ORM while connecting to a relational db (RDBMS i.e. a sql db like Oracle, PostgreSQL)
- in RDBMS you'll have tables and keys like primary keys, foreign keys which are relational to one another
- To connect a Java application to a RDBMS we need to use something like a JDBC
- JDBC will help tp run sql queries on the dB and will convert the results to an Object instance.
- ORM allows us to map a class entity to a table so that we don't have to specifically run a query but rather the framework (i.e, Spring) will do it for us
- JPA is a way for us to use ORM, i.e. it allows us to configure the entity classes and provide them to the framework which will take care of ORM.

Spring Data JPA is a project which allows us to connect to a RDBMS and let's us provide JPA configs. on entity classes and then Spring framework handles the ORM part of it

To create a repository layer:
1. add `spring-boot-starter-data-jpa`* dependency and a db dependency to pom.xml
2. Create @Entity class
3. create an interface which extends CrudRepository class
4. in the @service class @autowire the repository class creates in step 3. and write services easily using the functions of CrudRepository class
5. create a controller which will map url's to @service class' functions.


*As soon as we include Spring Boot Starter JPA in our project, we get the following features from a wide variety of dependencies:*

- Auto-configuration of an in-memory embedded database, which allows you to run your application without even setting up a database.
- Auto-import of the JPA API and Hibernate. Adding this dependency will automatically import the JPA API and use Hibernate as the default implementation.
- Auto-read of the data source and Hibernate configuration from application.properties.
- Auto-creation of the entities as tables and auto execution of import.sql.

=== Project setup in local:
1. mark only the `java` folder as source folder (in the module settings) in IntelliJ
2. you can change the server.port in application.properties file as per your need
3. download the postman collection present in this project
4. connect to the port mentioned in `application.properties`
5. Note: this project is compatible with jdk 1.8 and up
